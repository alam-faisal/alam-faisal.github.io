I'm a Quantum Algorithms Scientist at Phasecraft. The research directions I am most excited about right now are: 
* optimizing the implementation of quantum algorithms on hardware
* classical simulation of noiseless and noisy quantum computation
* quantum algorithms for time evolution
* dynamic quantum circuits

I graduated from Franklin & Marshall College with degrees in physics and mathematics. I then received a PhD in physics, with a focus on quantum algorithms, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with a 2 year stint at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the past I have worked on gravitational waves and bound states in quantum field theories. 

Outside of physics, my time is spent reading and writing fiction. I am also interested in history and philosophy, and enjoy weightlifting, cricket, racket sports and hiking.
