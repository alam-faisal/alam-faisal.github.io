I am a physics graduate student working on quantum information with Bryan K. Clark (link) at the University of Illinois. I am currently visiting Los Alamos National Lab as a graduate research assistant supervised by Lukasz Cincio. My main research interests at the moment are on dynamic quantum circuits, tensor networks for quantum information and quantum algorithms for time evolution. 

Previous research interests include gravitational waves and bound states in quantum field theory. Outside of physics, my time is spent on reading and writing fiction. I am also interested in history and philosophy, cricket and weightlifting.
