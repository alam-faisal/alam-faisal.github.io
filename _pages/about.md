I'm a graduate student specializing in quantum information at the University of Illinois, where I am a member of the [Clark group](https://clark.physics.illinois.edu/). I am currently visiting Los Alamos National Lab as a graduate researcher supervised by Lukasz Cincio. 

The research directions I am most excited about right now are: 
* compilation of quantum algorithms to hardware
* classical simulation of noiseless and noisy quantum computation
* quantum algorithms for time evolution and state preparation
* dynamic quantum circuits

In the past I have worked on gravitational waves and bound states in quantum field theories. 

Outside of physics, my time is spent reading and writing fiction. I am also interested in history and philosophy, and enjoy weightlifting and cricket.
